This project was broken up into 3 sections which you can find in the git branches. I mostly did this for fun to see what I could accomplish.

## 30 minute version:
- [x] Symbols should be X's and O's.
- [x] For the first game, X's should go first.
- [x] Players should be able to reset the game.
- [ ] Players should be able to start a new game after a game is finished.
- [ ] The loser of the previous game should start the next game.
- [x] Players would like to practice against a computer opponent.

## 60 minute version:
**All the previous and:**
- [x] Players should be able to start a new game after a game is finished.
- [x] The loser of the previous game should start the next game.
- [x] EXTRA: Tie game is shown

## 2 hour version:
